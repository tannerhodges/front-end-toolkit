# Generate JPG with alpha mask from transparent PNGs

Based on Dirk Weber's article [Applying Alpha Channels to JPGs](http://w3.eleqtriq.com/2014/08/applying-alpha-channels-to-jpgs/)

**Note**: While this Photoshop script + PHP works, [ZorroSVG](http://quasimondo.com/ZorroSVG/) is such a better implementation of the SVG alpha mask technique. It works in all modern browsers (IE9+, Safari 6+, etc.) and compresses images *so* much more (e.g. it saved 11KB from my demo out of the box).
